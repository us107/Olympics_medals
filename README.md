Predicting Country Medal Counts: Unveiling Patterns in Historical and Current Sports Data

# Description
This project aims to predict a country's future medal count in sports events using machine learning models. By analyzing a combination of historical and current data, including factors such as past medal counts, athlete participation, demographics, and other relevant features, the goal is to identify patterns contributing to a country's success. The hypothesis is that a well-trained machine learning model, leveraging a comprehensive dataset, can provide accurate predictions for a country's medal count in upcoming sports events. This analysis enhances our understanding of the diverse factors influencing a country's performance in sports competitions.

### Machine Learning Models Used

#### 1. Linear Regression

I employed Linear Regression to analyze and predict the relationship between variables in the dataset. This model is well-suited for scenarios where a linear relationship exists between the input features and the target variable.

#### 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Additionally, the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm was utilized to make predictions based on the similarity of data points. KNN is a versatile algorithm that doesn't assume a specific structure in the data, making it suitable for various types of datasets.
